#Week 1 Challenge Analysis
##Overview of the Project
###The purpose of this project was to help Louise compare how different Kickstarter campaigns fared based on their launch date and fundraising goals and to identify trends within the data. Using pivot tables, graphs, and charts, we were able to obtain a better overview of the data to find trends faster and develop our own conclusions about the relationship between success rates and goals versus success rates and launch dates. 
##Analysis and Challenges
###I performed my analysis by first organizing the data and converting the timestamp on the data from Unix timestamp to a readable date. This was done by inserting a new column and using the equation “=(((J4043/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)” in the first cell of the new column. Then I changed the number format from “General” to “Short Date” and applied the results to the rest of the cells. Using the data in the new column, I created a pivot table and put the new dates in the rows, the Kickstarter outcomes in the columns, and count of outcomes in the values. Then, I created a line graph using this data to better see which months were most successful, least successful, and canceled for the Kickstarter campaigns. I created a pivot table for outcomes based on Goals as well but encountered some problems in copying and pasting the =COUNTIFS formulas from one cell to the next. Without the use of absolute values in my =COUNTIFS equation, the cell numbers shifted when I copied and pasted the formula from cell B2 to cell C2. I had to rewrite the formula for C2 and D2 because the results were coming back as “0” for the entire row and then comb through the equations from each cell to make sure I put the correct numbers within each equation. This part was the most challenging and tedious portion of the entire challenge.

##Results
###Using the line graphs created from the “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date”, one can ascertain that the month of May was the peak of success rates while winter months had the lowest rates of success as well as the highest rates of failure for the theater. For the data using the “Outcomes Based on Goals” line graph, we see that the highest rates of success occurred in the $25k to $35k goals. However, using the pivot table, we know that a majority of projects had a goal less than $10k and only a small number of projects had a goal between $25k and $35k so this data may be unreliable and limiting. I propose that coming up with a table on outcomes based on category and goals will better help Louise find trends as well as a pivot table for outcomes based on country. Certain countries have a different currency rate than the US which limits our ability to accurately look for trends in the “Outcomes Based on Goals” table. Similarly, since there is typically a larger budget for a film versus a play, compiling data and organizing them by category and then looking for trends in “Outcomes Based on Goals” would help us make more accurate conclusions about the Kickstarter campaigns.
